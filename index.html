							<p>In July, I deleted Facebook. Hard-deleted. I deleted Instagram shortly thereafter. I’m done with my Kindle. I’m donating my iPad 3 to charity. I have a desktop anchored to my desk at work. I leave my personal MacBook Pro at home.</p>

							<p>In August, I went to France for 2.5 weeks of holiday where I spent the duration of my time there entirely without a personal, portable communication device. Over the course of that 17-day period, I read seven books.</p>

							<p>Seven books.</p>

							<p>“I’m tired of reaching for my phone every few minutes. I’m tired of seeing everybody else staring into their phones all the time. I’m tired of talking to friends and seeing all of us simultaneously reach for our phones as if telepathy dictated that we all needed some mental break from having to deal with each other because it’s so fucking stressful or tiring or something.”</p>

							<p>They shook their heads in a way which implied they understood me but really they just pitied me.</p>

							<p>They took me to the small, dust-covered corner of the shop where three devices sat — two Samsung devices and one other device whose brand I’d never heard of before. For $100, I could buy the mid-range phone outright without having to sign a contract and go month-to-month.</p>

							<p>Yesterday, I was walking home from lunch when I decided to pop into the Rogers store in Yaletown, Vancouver. The two friendly guys asked if they could help me. As if some supernatural entity was possessing my body, I responded that I was in the market for a flip phone, a “not-smart” phone, a dumb phone.</p>

							<p>They were stunned. Hell, I was stunned.</p>

							<p>This collective shock further fuelled my desire for a dumb phone:</p>

							<p>“Yeah, I want a flip phone. I have an iPhone 4 and I want a flip phone.”</p>

							<p>Then I climbed up on my soapbox:</p>
